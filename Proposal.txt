- CS210 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL, Fall 2023
===========================================================================
- PROJECT TITLE GOES HERE
- Name: Rylee Au
- Section: T6
- Documentation Statement:  Discussed this with Major Sample
===========================================================================

OVERVIEW:
This is where you will write a brief description of your project.  
You do not need to write a lot, but you do need to provide enough detail for 
your instructor to get a good understanding of what you would like to do.

The wordle game. The user can choose the mode of difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
which relate to the number of letters in the word (5,6,7). This chooses the word
from one of the three separate txt files of listed words based on modes. The 
user places an initial guess. Comparing the guess and the actual word, if the letter
is in the right place it will print the letter in green to console. If the letter is 
in the word but not in the right place it will print the letter in red to console. 
If the letter is not in the word at all it will print in black to console.

===========================================================================

INTERFACE MECHANISM:
How will users interact with your program?  Is it with Curses, command line, etc?

Console I/O

===========================================================================

Required Programming Skills (must have 5 of 6):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Pointer use with dynamic memory (malloc and free)
	How are you going to meet this req:
      The guessed word and actual word will be dynamically allocated based 
      on the difficulty (number of letters chosen for the wordle word)

   2) Pointers as a key component of a data structure
	How are you going to meet this req:

   3) File I/O
	How are you going to meet this req:
      The txt files for the difficulties will contain a lists of words which
      needs to be opened and closed to choose a random word.

   4) Structs
	How are you going to meet this req:
      Structure for each game. The difficulty, guessed word, actual word, past guesses,
      guessed letters.

   5) String manipulation
	How are you going to meet this req:
      Add guessed letters to a string, added past guesses to 2D array, 
      update the current guess

   6) Processing of array data
	How are you going to meet this req:
      Iterate through the guessed word in comparison to the actual word and print the
      resulting colors based on the status of the guessed letters in the actual word

Required Advanced Programming Skills (1 of the below):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Recursion
	How are you going to meet this req:

   2) 2D Dynamic Memory
	How are you going to meet this req:
      read the txt file to a dynamically allocated 2D array and randomly choose
      a word from the array

   3) Linked List (or some other advanced data structure)
	How are you going to meet this req:

   4) A GUI (xwindows for Ubuntu)
	How are you going to meet this req:

   5) Some other advanced skill (approve with your instructor)
	How are you going to meet this req:
